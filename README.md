# Abstract

   The RoboCup football league is a robotics and artificial intelligence workspace that has received a lot of attention. In the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL), one of the RoboCup 
leagues, football is played with 2 teams consisting of more than one robot. Robots are expected to act autonomously. In this field of study, strategy software, artificial 
intelligence, computer vision, etc. studies are included.

   Real-time and accurate robot pose identification is one of the most important issues for RoboCup. In this project, the robot pose to be used in RoboCup SSL competitions has 
been examined. The pose contains the position and angle data of a robot. Image processing methods have been evaluated to find the position of the robot. Deep learning algorithms 
are used to access angle information of robots with positions. Deep learning algorithms have quite a large computational load. For this reason, Jetson Nano Developer kit was used 
in the project in order to be able to calculate deep learning algorithms and provide high performance inference. A real-time game is in progress in the RoboCup football league.  
Therefore, robot pose detection with high precision in the lowest processing time is aimed in the project.
